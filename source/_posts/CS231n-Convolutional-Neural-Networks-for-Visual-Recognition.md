####Fresh Start:
Recently, I found this course and the material is interesting but elemental. Even though it does not contain video lectures, the slides and assignments are very well organized. Therefore, I decide to start following this course and get hands-on experience about Convolutional Neural Networks instead of just reading papers. 

####Goal:

* Get hands-on experience of building CNN.
* Get familiar(read the analyze) with the code of caffe. 

####Resources
* [Course Website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html)
